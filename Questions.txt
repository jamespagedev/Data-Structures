Link Lists:
1) How would you insert an element into an empty link list? And what about a link list with only 1 element?
2) How would you iterate along a link list to reach an element that isn't the head or tail of the list?
3) How would you delete an element from the link list?
4) What is the difference (in code) when you use (node.head and node.tail) vs (node.prev and node.next)?
5) What is the difference between a link list, a double link list, and a reverse link list?
6) What would some of the use cases for a link list, double link list, and reverse link list look like?
7) I've heard link lists are slow and nobody uses them anymore. If that is true what do we use instead?

Queues:
1) Can you give some examples on when you would want to use FIFO vs FILO? What data structs exhibit this ordering?
2) What data structs are used to implement a queue?
